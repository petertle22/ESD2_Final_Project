% MatlabClient_Final performs the following:
% - Waits for the GUI to initialize its parameters
% - Once GUI initiates process, connects to server over wifi
% - Sends INIT PARAMETERS protocol to server
% - Enters REQUEST-RETRIEVE-RESPOND LOOP to send frames to the server
% - Once told to stop, requests results
% - Receives results to diaply on GUI including some debugging graphics
